# Introduction

This repository contains trained reference sets that can be used with the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (Wang et al., 2007) to taxonomically assign Eukaryote 18S rDNA sequences.

# Releases

## July 12, 2018

18Sv2.0 was created to classify Eukaryotes for Jesse Hoage's Master's thesis.  18S rDNA sequences were mined from GenBank July 24, 2017.

18Sv1.0 was created to specifically classify diatoms (Bacillariophyta).  18S rDNA sequences were mined from GenBank August 25, 2016.
